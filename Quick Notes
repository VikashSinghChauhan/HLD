âš¡ Quick Numbers

HTTP POST (polling every 1s): ~500â€“1000 bytes/request â†’ 60 KB per user per minute. With 100K users â†’ ~6 GB/min traffic.

WebSocket frame: ~10â€“50 bytes per update â†’ 600 bytes/min/user. With 100K users â†’ ~60 MB/min traffic.
ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s ~100x more efficient.

âœ… Rule of Thumb

If updates are frequent (sub-second to few seconds) â†’ use WebSockets (or SSE if one-way).

If updates are rare (every few mins, on demand) â†’ simple HTTP API is fine.
